                  from the aesthetic alone. I've since moved on to other keyboard pastures as all cowboys do, \
                  but this holds a proud spot in my heart as a personal project that made it to about a dozen \
                  countries when I sold and shipped to any daring enough to try it."

                  choc sunset switches. Asymplex thumb keycaps. Heated seats and convertible roof. This is my \
                  mainstay at work because it makes no compromises, except for a bit of extra setup time."

    description: "A board that works surprisingly well for all the iterations I made from the prior gen. Besides the \
                  newly released pink PCB's, I also used new controllers and brought back the horizontal encoders all \
                  in one go. Changing so much at once was nerve-wracking, but a Discord server of nerds gave me all \
                  the scrutiny I needed to get it right the first time, free of charge."

    description: "\"To show you the power of pinky clusters, I sawed this keyboard in half!\" And also it looks \
                  like a shoe, huh. So yeah, the clog can be soldered together in half an hour or less and will \
                  last for years because it's simple and just works (tm). I'd recommend newer iterations at this point, \
                  though, so you can benefit from my greater design experience."

                  the Osprette MX is a wonderfully comfortable package that gets months of battery life. \
                  This is the closest I've come to a perfect board from a design and ergonomics perspective, \
                  and it wins the most used award across all of my designs."

    description: "The splitting image of the Osprette MX is my weapon of choice when clacking up a \
                  storm at home. The board earns the name of the fan favorite villain by looking good \
                  but feeling better. I haven't used the stacked case design since, but I highly recommend \
                  it if you want an inexpensive build that feels expensive.",

    description: "My first finished design. For an early evolution from the primordial design ooze, \
                  I still think it would be a great board to daily if you don't wanna go full pinky \
                  cluster (yet). Maybe if enough people bug me for non-cluster boards like this one I'll \
                  design another, but what can I say, I know what I like."
